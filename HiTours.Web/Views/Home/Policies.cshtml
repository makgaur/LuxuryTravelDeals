                <p>Luxury Travel Deals uses cookies and similar technologies to recognise you when you visit our our site or our app. The following section explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them. </p>
                <br>
                <div class="head1">What are cookies? </div>
                <p>Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information. Cookies set by us are called “first party cookies”. Cookies set by parties other than us are called “third party cookies”. Third party cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g. like advertising, interactive content and analytics). The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognise your device both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites. </p>
                <br>
                <div class="head1">Why do we use cookies? </div>
                <p>We use first party and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our site or our app to operate, and we refer to these as “essential” or “strictly necessary” cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site or our app. Third parties serve cookies through our site or our app for advertising, analytics and other purposes. This is described in more detail below. </p>
                <br>
                <div class="head1">Types of cookie</div>
                <div>
                    The specific types of first and third-party cookies served through our site or our app and the purposes they perform are described in the table below (please note that the specific cookies served may vary depending on the specific site or our app you visit):
                    <div>
                        <div>
                            <div class="head2">Essential website cookies: </div>
                            These cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our site or our app and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <div class="head2">Performance and functionality cookies: </div>
                            These cookies are used to enhance the performance and functionality of our site or our app but are non-essential to their use. However, without these cookies, certain functionality may become unavailable.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <div class="head2">Analytics and customisation cookies: </div>
                            These cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our site or our app are being used or how effective are marketing campaigns are, or to help us customise our site or our app for you.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <div class="head2">Advertising cookies: </div>
                            These cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you. They perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed for advertisers, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <div class="head2">Social networking cookies: </div>
                            These cookies are used to enable you to share pages and content that you find interesting on our site or our app through third party social networking and other websites. These cookies may also be used for advertising purposes too.
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div><br>
                <div class="head1">What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons? </div>
                <p>
                    Cookies are not the only way to recognise or track visitors to a website. We may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called “tracking pixels” or “clear gifs”). These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognise when someone has visited our site or our app or opened an e-mail that we have sent them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our site or our app to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our site or our app from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of e-mail marketing campaigns. In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.
                    
                </p><br>
                <div class="head1">Do you serve targeted advertising? </div>
                <p>Third parties may serve cookies on your computer or mobile device to serve advertising through our site or our app. These companies may use information about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services that you may be interested in. They may also employ technology that is used to measure the effectiveness of advertisements. This can be accomplished by them using cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to this and other sites in order to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services of potential interest to you. The information collected through this process does not enable us or them to identify your name, contact details or other personally identifying details unless you choose to provide these.  </p>
                <br>
                <div class="head1">How can I control cookies? </div>
                <p>You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our website though your access to some functionality and areas of our website may be restricted. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser’s help menu for more information. In addition, most advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of targeted advertising.

                            These cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you. They perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed for advertisers, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests.

                            These cookies are used to enable you to share pages and content that you find interesting on our site or our app through third party social networking and other websites. These cookies may also be used for advertising purposes too.

                <p>
                    Cookies are not the only way to recognise or track visitors to a website. We may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called “tracking pixels” or “clear gifs”). These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognise when someone has visited our site or our app or opened an e-mail that we have sent them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our site or our app to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our site or our app from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of e-mail marketing campaigns. In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.

                </p><br>
                <div class="head1">Do you serve targeted advertising? </div>
                <p>Third parties may serve cookies on your computer or mobile device to serve advertising through our site or our app. These companies may use information about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services that you may be interested in. They may also employ technology that is used to measure the effectiveness of advertisements. This can be accomplished by them using cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to this and other sites in order to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services of potential interest to you. The information collected through this process does not enable us or them to identify your name, contact details or other personally identifying details unless you choose to provide these.  </p>

                <div class="head1">How can I control cookies? </div>
                <p>You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies.
